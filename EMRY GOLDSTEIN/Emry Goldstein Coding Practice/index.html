    <h1>Lybia edmondsoni</h1>
    <img src="crab1.jpg">

<p style="color:red">Lybia edmondsoni is a species of small crab in the family Xanthidae and is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Like other members of the genus Lybia, it is commonly known as the pom-pom crab or boxer crab because of its habit of carrying a sea anemone around in each of its claws, these resembling pom-poms or boxing gloves. Its Hawaiian name is kÅ«mimi pua, meaning "inedible flower crab". In ancient times, this animal was used by men claiming to be sorcerers</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<img src="craby.gif" alt="">
<p style="color:rgb(245, 165, 27)">The carapace of L. edmondsoni can reach 0.5 inches (13 mm) in width. It sports unusual polygonal patterns in pink, brown or yellow. The chelipeds are not heavily armoured as in most crab species but are fine and delicate, the propodal-carpal joint being very flexible, and there are several backward-pointing spines. The walking legs are banded in dark purple. On its favorite substrates, such as thin sand or rubble, the crab is almost invisible.</p>
<p>The common name "pom-pom crab" comes from its symbiotic practice of brandishing a stinging sea anemone (usually Triactis producta) in each claw to defend against predators and possibly to stun prey. Its alternative common name, "boxer crab", comes from its pugnacious response to threats</p>
<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
<p style="">Lybia edmondsoni is endemic to Hawaii but is very similar in its size and behavior to its sister species, L. tessellata, which is much more widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific. L. edmondsoni is found in shallow water, down to a depth of about 20 m (66 ft), and hides under rocks or among coral debris. It is also found on sandy and gravelly flats, where it is well camouflaged, and on live corals where it clings with its long, slender legs.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>

<br>
<p> Lybia edmondsoni has relatively unarmoured chelae and is neither able to defend itself well nor feed itself efficiently as do other crabs. The sea anemones it holds are grasped delicately with its chelae and are then held in place by several small spines. The anemones are used defensively and also gather food particles with their tentacles which the crab scrapes off for its own use. The crabs often molt at night, and by the morning, although their shell is not yet fully hardened, they have already grasped hold of their anemones</p>
<p>The sea anemone T. producta can undergo asexual reproduction by fission. In the research study mentioned below, two crabs that only had one anemone each when caught, and two others that each had one anemone removed, were all found to have a partial anemone in each claw during the course of the next few days. These went on to develop into normal individuals. One crab was observed in the process of pulling an anemone in half by holding it with both its chelae and then drawing them apart until the tissues parted</p>
