<p>On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement.

<p><b>Tokuma Shoten era</b></p>
<p>
    Founded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. 
    Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on <i>The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun</i> in 1968 and the <i>Panda! Go, Panda!</i> films in 1972 and 1973. 
    In 1978, Suzuki became an editor at Tokuma Shoten's <i>Animage</i> manga magazine, where the first film he chose was <i>Horus</i>. 
    A year after his phone call with Takahata and his first encounter with Miyazaki, both about <i>Horus</i>, he made a phone call about the first film Miyazaki ever directed: <i>The Castle of Cagliostro</i>.

    The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film <i>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</i>. Suzuki was part of the film's production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join them. 
</p>
<p>
    he studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i>). 
    Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. 
    Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. 
    In their book <i>Anime Classics Zettai!</i>, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as "a mainstay of Studio Ghibli's extraordinary design and production team".
    At one time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
    In August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership wherein Walt Disney Studios would be the sole international distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli animated films.
    Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to finance 10% of the studio's production costs.
    Since then, all three aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by Disney.
    On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one location.

    Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine Animage, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli Notes." 
    Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. 
    Saeko Himuro's novel <i>Umi ga Kikoeru</i> was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into <i>Ocean Waves</i>, Studio Ghibli's first animated feature-length film created for television. 
    It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.

    In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo.
    It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    The studio is also known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad due to <i>Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind</i> being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as <i>Warriors of the Wind</i>.
    The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing <i>Princess Mononoke</i> to make it more marketable.
    A Studio Ghibli producer is rumoured to have sent an authentic Japanese sword with a simple message: "No cuts".
