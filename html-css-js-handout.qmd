# Takeaway

* HTML, CSS and JavaScripts are the most popular _languanges_ behind almost every website.
* Web browsers (Chrome, Safari, or Edge) hold the _dictionary_ to understand these languages and put on the nice-looking appearance of websites.
* Under the hood, they are plain texts which you can view & edit with any <b>text editor</b>. 

# Introducing the Band

In a webpage

* **HTML** (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) lays out its contents and structure
* **CSS** (**C**asacading **S**tyle **S**heets) describe the style of its contents
* **JavaScript** further adds interactivity and functionalities

You can :eyes: these source code of a web page from your browser.
For example, in Chrome, 

* You can right click a white space on the page and choose **View Page Source** (this will show you the entire HTML document of that page)
* You can also right click a link, an image or anything on the page and choose **Inspect** (this will highlight the thing you clicked and show you all related source code)

If the code file looks too complicated and scary, don't panic.
We will start from the basic.

## HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>A Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>An Interesting Page</h1>
        <p>An exciting paragraph of text.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

* HTML documents usually have file extension `.html`
* An HTML document begins with [a declaration of the document type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration): `<!DOCTYPE html>`
* The first impression of an HTML document usually consist of elements organized as a series of nested **containers** with contents enclosed by **tags** (`<>`). @fig-html-tag shows the common atanomy of an HTML element.

* These tags are where the name "**markup language**" in HTML comes from; they are used to enrich the text by encoding the structure, formatting or relationships between different parts of a docuemnt.
* At a high level, 
  * Everything on the page is contained and enclosed by `<html>   </html>`
  * `<head>   </head>` contains _meta information_ of the page such as the title, the style sheets (more on this later), and the scripts for functionalities. These are usually _invisible_.
  * `<body>   </body>` contains the contents (text, links, and images) we see and interact with on the page.
* We will go over some useful HTML tags later. For a comprehensive list, check out [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp).
