    pires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease. </span></p> 
    
   <p>
    <span style="color:#be3764;">There were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the Blade franchise
     as an antagonist and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainmen
     t, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters begin
     ing with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama
      and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa 
      officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the 
      year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in 
      February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 
      2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February.

    <p> <span style="color:#be3764; "> Morbius premiered at the Plaza Carso
         in Mexico City on March 10, 2022, and was theatrically released in the 
         United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from
          an initial July 2020 date, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It 
          received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism towards 
          its writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, though Smith's 
          performance received some praise. The film was a box-office bomb and 
          grossed $167 million worldwide. </span></p>

          
 <h  ><span style="color:#90dbf9; ">Plot</span> </h3> 
 
 <br>

 <p> <span style="color:#be3764;"> At a hospital in Greece, 10-year-old Michael Morbius welcomes his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo; they bond over their shared blood illness and desire to be "normal". Their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo.

    25 years later, Morbius publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with artificial blood. His colleague Martine Bancroft discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica in the hope of splicing their genes with his own to cure his condition. After informing Milo of his planned illegal experiment, Morbius receives funding from him to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Morbius into a vampire, who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Once his bloodlust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Morbius erases all CCTV footage of his experiment before contacting the authorities and jumping overboard.
</span></p>

<p> <span style="color:#be3764; "> Morbius returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as one of their own. To control his bloodlust, he subsists on his artificial blood as it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. FBI agents Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez investigate Morbius' victims and deduce his involvement. Milo learns that Morbius is cured but becomes furious when Morbius refuses to cure him as well. While checking on 
    a hospitalized Bancroft, Morbius finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible, he attempts to escape before being cornered and arrested by Stroud. In prison, he is visited by Milo, who offers to use his wealth to free him. Upon realizing Milo took his cure and killed the nurse, Morbius escapes to confront him. An unrepentant Milo confesses to his bloodlust-induced crime and urges Morbius to embrace his powers as he has. 
    Unwilling to hurt his brother, Morbius flees.</span> </p>
    <p> <span style="color:#be3764; "> Morbius meets Bancroft to explain what Milo has done before acquiring a new lab and developing an antibody against vampirism to stop and kill Milo; he also plans to use it on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks and, believing Morbius' vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes Milo and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Morbius, Milo wounds and forces him to call Morbius, who arrives too late to save him while Milo also mortally wounds Bancroft. Morbius returns to Bancroft, but she dies in his arms, forcing him to drink her blood. Morbius confronts Milo and summons an army of bats to restrain him and inject the antibody. Milo dies peacefully and Morbius flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire. Unbeknownst to him, Bancroft revives elsewhere as a red-eyed vampire, having ingested a drop of 
        Morbius' blood whilst he was feeding on her. </span> </p>
